        task. Our model architecture incorporates building blocks from multiple domains.
        It contains convolutional layers, an attention mechanism, and sparsely-gated
        layers. Each of these computational blocks is crucial for a subset of the
        tasks we train on. Interestingly, even if a block is not crucial for a task,
        we observe that adding it never hurts performance and in most cases improves
        it on all tasks. We also show that tasks with less data benefit largely from
        joint training with other tasks, while performance on large tasks degrades
        only slightly if at all. Show less\\n\\nAttention Is All You Need\\n\\nThe

        translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art
        BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction
        of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that

        to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

        separable convolutions reduce the number of parameters and computation used
        in convolutional operations while increasing representational efficiency.
        They have been shown to be successful in image classification models, both
        in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given parameter
        count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the number of

        convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks have been applied to machine translation

        can be applied to neural machine translation. We introduce a new architecture
        inspired by Xception and ByteNet, called SliceNet, which enables a significant
        reduction of the parameter count and amount of computation needed to obtain
        results like ByteNet, and, with a similar parameter count, achieves new state-of-the-art
        results. In addition to showing that depthwise separable convolutions perform
        well for machine translation, we investigate the architectural changes that
        they enable: we observe that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase
        the length of convolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation.
        We also introduce a new \\\"super-separable\\\" convolution operation that
        further reduces the number of parameters and computational cost for obtaining

        Inc. is a Canadian multinational technology company focused on artificial
        intelligence for the enterprise, specializing in large language models. Cohere
        was founded in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang, and Nick Frosst, and is headquartered
        in Toronto and San Francisco, with offices in Palo Alto, London, and New York
        City.\\n\\nIn 2017, a team of researchers at Google Brain introduced the transformer
        machine learning architecture in \\\"Attention Is All You Need,\\\" which
        demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language
        processing tasks. In 2019, Aiden Gomez, one of its co-authors, along with
        Nick Frosst, another researcher at Google Brain, founded Cohere with Ivan
        Zhang, with whom Gomez had done research at FOR.ai. All of the co-founders
        attended University of Toronto.\\n\\nGomez is the company's CEO. In December
        2022, Martin Kon, the former CFO of YouTube, became president and COO.\\n\\nIn
        November 2021, Google Cloud announced that they would help power Cohere's
        platform using their robust infrastructure, and Cloud's TPUs would be used
        by Cohere for the development and deployment of their products.\\n\\nIn June
        2022, Cohere launched Cohere For AI, a nonprofit research lab and community
        dedicated to contributing open-source, fundamental machine learning research.
        It is led by Sara Hooker, a former research scientist at Google Brain.\\n\\nIn
        December 2022, Cohere released a multilingual model for understanding text
        that would work with over 100 languages, to help users search for documents
        by meaning instead of with keywords. This type of process was not previously
        widely available in languages other than English.\\n\\nOn June 13, 2023, Oracle
        announced a partnership with Cohere to provide generative AI services to help
        organizations automate end-to-end business processes. As a result, Cohere's
        technology is integrated into Oracle's business applications, including Oracle
        Fusion Cloud, Oracle NetSuite, and Oracle industry-specific applications.
        On July 18, 2023, McKinsey announced a collaboration with Cohere, to help
        organizations integrate generative AI into their operations. In 2023, Cohere
        collaborated with software company LivePerson to offer customized large language
        models for businesses.\\n\\nOn September 12, 2023, it was announced that Cohere
        had become one of 15 tech companies to agree to voluntary White House measures
        on testing, reporting, and research on the risks of AI. On September 27, 2023,
        it was announced that Cohere had also signed Canada's voluntary code of conduct
        for AI, to promote the responsible development and management of advanced
        generative AI systems.\\n\\nConsidered an alternative to OpenAI, Cohere is
        focused on generative AI for the enterprise, building technology that businesses
        can use to deploy chatbots, search engines, copywriting, summarization, and
        other AI-driven products. Cohere specializes in large language models: AI
        trained to digest text from an enterprises' internal data or publicly available
        sources like the internet to understand how to process and respond to prompts
        with increasing sophistication.\\n\\nThe Cohere platform is available through
        API as a managed service, through platforms such as Amazon SageMaker and Google's
        Vertex AI. It can be used for tasks such as writing copy, moderating content,
        classifying data, and extracting information. It is cloud agnostic and not
        tied to a particular cloud service.\\n\\nCohere's generative AI technology
        is embedded into several Oracle products, and its chat capabilities are embedded
        into Salesforce products.\\n\\nOn September 7, 2021, Cohere announced that
        they had raised $40 million in Series A funding led by Index Ventures; Index
        Ventures partner Mike Volpi also joined Cohere's board. The round also included
        Radical Ventures, Section 32, and AI-experts Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li,
        Pieter Abbeel, and Raquel Urtasun.\\n\\nIn February 2022, Cohere announced
        they had raised $125 million in series B funding led by Tiger Global. In June
        2023, Cohere raised an additional $270 million in series C funding from investors
        including Inovia Capital, Oracle, Salesforce, and Nvidia, at a valuation of
        $2.2 billion.\",\"timestamp\":\"2024-06-08T16:48:23\",\"title\":\"Cohere -

        It was very exciting and surprising afterward to learn the consequences of
        the work and what got created from the foundation.\u201D\\n\\nSince then,
        all of the co-authors of the paper have left Google to pursue their own ventures.
        That includes Gomez, who is now the CEO of Cohere, an enterprise-focused company
        he co-founded that helps businesses implement AI into their chatbots, search
        engines, and other product offerings. This year, the Toronto-based Cohere
        raised $270 million from companies including chipmaker Nvidia and venture-capital
        firm Index Ventures, and was valued at over $2 billion. Its backers include
        AI luminaries like Geoffrey Hinton. (Investors in Cohere also include Salesforce,
        where TIME co-chair and owner Marc Benioff is CEO.)\\n\\nGomez chose to focus
        on working with businesses because he believed that it was the \u201Cbest
        way to close the gap\u201D between AI models being explored in theory vs.
        being deployed out in the world. In particular, he is excited by AI\u2019s
        potential to improve customer support, which he believes will be one of the
        first \u201Ckiller apps\u201D for AI.\\n\\nGomez dismisses AI doomerism: he
        has called the idea of AI being a threat to human existence \u201Cabsurd.\u201D
        Rather, he hopes that AI language models will be implemented into every online
        interaction. \u201CI want the default mode of interaction for any website
        or service you land to be talking to it\u2014because that\u2019s what we do
        with humans,\u201D he says. \u201CThis is our most natural interface for intellectual
        exchange, and I want that to be supported with our technology as well.\u201D\\n\\nMore
