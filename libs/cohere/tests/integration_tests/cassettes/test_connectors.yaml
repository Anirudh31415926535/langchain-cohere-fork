        Part Two is a 2024 epic science fiction film directed and produced by Denis
        Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts. The sequel to Dune
        (2021), it is the second of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel Dune by
        Frank Herbert. It follows Paul Atreides as he unites with the Fremen people
        of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen. Timoth\xE9e
        Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsg\xE5rd, Dave Bautista,
        Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the
        first film, with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and L\xE9a
        Seydoux joining the ensemble cast.\\n\\nDevelopment began after Legendary
        Entertainment acquired film and television rights for the Dune franchise in
        2016. Villeneuve signed on as director in 2017, intending to make a two-part
        adaptation of the novel due to its complexity. Production contracts were only
        secured for the first film, with the second film having to be greenlit based
        on the first's success. After the critical and commercial success of the first
        film, Legendary green-lit Dune: Part Two in October 2021. Principal photography
        took place in Budapest, Italy, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi between July and December
        2022.\\n\\nAfter being delayed from an original November 2023 release date
        due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the film premiered at the Odeon
        Luxe Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and was released in the
        United States on March 1. Like its predecessor, it received generally positive
        reviews from critics, and is considered by some to be one of the best science
        fiction films of all time. The film set several box office records and has
        grossed over $711.8 million worldwide, surpassing its predecessor and making
        it the highest-grossing film of 2024. A sequel based on Herbert's 1969 novel
        Dune Messiah is in development.\\n\\nFollowing the destruction of House Atreides
        by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam
        IV, secretly journals her distaste over how her father betrayed the Atreides.
        On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul Atreides and his pregnant
        Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica
        and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar
        and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \\\"Outer
        World\\\" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.\\n\\nStilgar tells Jessica that
        she must succeed Sietch Tabr's dying Reverend Mother by drinking the Water
        of Life\u2014a poison fatal for males and untrained women. Her Bene Gesserit
        training allows Jessica to transmute and survive the poison, inheriting the
        memories of all the past Reverend Mothers. The liquid also prematurely awakens
        the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with
        her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen
        of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, correctly believe the prophecy
        was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen, but begins to respect Paul after
        he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule
        them.\\n\\nPaul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen
        culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm,
        and raiding Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names \\\"Usul\\\"
        and \\\"Muad'Dib\\\". Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen
        replaces his nephew, Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his more cunning yet
        psychotic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit,
        is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and secure
        his genetic lineage.\\n\\nJessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists
        who believe most strongly in the prophecy. Paul remains in the north, fearful
        that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south
        as a messiah. During a raid on a smuggler spice harvester, Paul reunites with
        Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic warhead stockpile of House
        Atreides. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremens,
        destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors
        to journey south. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into
        a coma. This angers Chani, but Jessica compels her to mix her tears with the
        liquid, which awakens Paul. Now possessing clairvoyance across space and time,
        Paul sees an adult Alia on water-filled Arrakis. He also sees a singular path
        to victory among all possible futures, and that his mother Jessica is Baron
        Harkonnen's daughter.\\n\\nPaul meets with the southern Fremen war council,
        galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest
        thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam,
        who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar. As Shaddam chastises
        the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics
        and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Paul executes the Baron and captures
        Shaddam and his entourage. Meanwhile, Gurney leads an assault on Arrakeen,
        intercepting and killing Rabban.\\n\\nPaul challenges Shaddam for the throne
        and, to Chani's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Previously summoned by the
        Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit\u2014Paul threatens to destroy the
        spice fields with atomic weapons if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers
        to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's
        request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam surrenders,
        but the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, so he orders the Fremen to
        attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar
        ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Paul's holy war. Chani
        insolently refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm.\\n\\nTimoth\xE9e

        communicating to Jessica while in her womb. Babs Olusanmokun and Roger Yuan
        reprise their roles from the first film as Jamis and Lieutenant Lanville,
        respectively. Stephen McKinley Henderson filmed scenes reprising his role
        as Thufir Hawat, while Tim Blake Nelson filmed scenes as an undisclosed character,
        but their scenes were not included in the final cut. Both were given a \\\"Special
        Thanks\\\" credit by Villeneuve.\\n\\nIn November 2016, Legendary Pictures
        obtained the film and TV rights for the Dune franchise, based on the eponymous
        1965 novel by Frank Herbert. Vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary
        Mary Parent began discussing with Denis Villeneuve about directing a film
        adaptation, quickly hiring him after realizing his passion for Dune. In February
        2018, Villeneuve was confirmed to be hired as director, and intended to adapt
        the novel as a two-part film series. Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-film
        deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaption
        of Stephen King's It in 2017 and 2019. In January 2019, Joe Walker was confirmed
        as the film's editor. Other crew included Brad Riker as supervising art director,
        Patrice Vermette as production designer, Paul Lambert as visual effects supervisor,
        Gerd Nefzer as special effects supervisor, and Thomas Struthers as stunt coordinator.\\n\\nDune:
        Part Two was produced by Villeneuve, Mary Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya
        Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts,
        Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison, and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive
        producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant. Legendary CEO Joshua
        Grode confirmed in April 2019 that they plan to make a sequel, adding that
        \\\"there's a logical place to stop the [first] movie before the book is over\\\".\\n\\nIn
        December 2020, Villeneuve stated that due to Warner Bros.' plan to release
        the film in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously, the first film could underperform
        financially, resulting in cancellation of the planned sequel. In an IMAX screening
        of the first film's first ten minutes, the title logo read Dune: Part One,
        lending credence to plans for the sequel. In August 2021, Villeneuve spoke
        more confidently about the chances of a sequel film, iterating his excitement
        to work with Timoth\xE9e Chalamet and Zendaya again, while stating Chani would
        have a bigger role in the sequel. Warner Bros. assured Villeneuve a sequel
        would be greenlit as long as the film performed well on HBO Max. Just days
        prior to the first film's release, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff stated, \\\"Will
        we have a sequel to Dune? If you watch the movie you see how it ends. I think
        you pretty much know the answer to that.\\\"\\n\\nOn October 26, 2021, Legendary
        officially greenlit Dune: Part Two, with a spokesperson for the company stating,
        \\\"We would not have gotten to this point without the extraordinary vision
        of Denis and the amazing work of his talented crew, the writers, our stellar
        cast, our partners at Warner Bros., and of course the fans! Here's to more
        Dune.\\\" Production work had occurred back-to-back with the first film, as
        Villeneuve and his wife Lapointe immediately took a flight to Budapest in
        order to begin pre-production work. A key point of negotiation prior to greenlighting
        the sequel was assuring that the sequel would have an exclusive window where
        it would only be shown theatrically, with Legendary and Warner Bros. agreeing
        to give Dune: Part Two a 45-day window before it would be available through
        other channels. Villeneuve said this theatrical exclusivity was a \\\"non-negotiable
        condition\\\", and that \\\"the theatrical experience is at the very heart
        of the cinematic language for me\\\". With Dune: Part Two being greenlit,
        Villeneuve said that his primary concern was to complete the filming as soon
        as possible, with the earliest he expected to start in the last quarter of
        2022. He noted that production would be expedited by the work already done
        for the first film.\\n\\nEric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay in
        April 2017 for the Dune films, and Jon Spaihts was later confirmed to be co-writing
        the script alongside Roth and Villeneuve. Game of Thrones language creator
        David Peterson was confirmed to be developing languages for the film in April
        2019. Villeneuve and Peterson had created the Chakobsa language, which was
        used by actors on set. In November 2019, Spaihts stepped down as show-runner
        for Dune: Prophecy to focus on Dune: Part Two. In June 2020, Greig Fraser
        said, \\\"It's a fully formed story in itself with places to go. It's a fully
        standalone epic film that people will get a lot out of when they see it\\\".\\n\\nBetween
        the release of Dune and the confirmation of Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve started
        working the script in a way that production could begin immediately once the
        film was greenlit. By February 2021, Roth created a full treatment for the
        sequel, with writing beginning that August. He confirmed that Feyd-Rautha
        would appear in the film, and stated he will be a \\\"very important character\\\".
        In March 2022, Villeneuve had mostly finished writing the screenplay. Craig
        Mazin and Roth wrote additional literary material for the film.\\n\\nVilleneuve
        stated that the film would continue directly from the first, and specifically
        described it as being the \\\"second part\\\". He described the film as being
        an \\\"epic war movie\\\", adding that while the first film was more \\\"contemplative\\\",
        the second would feature more action. Villeneuve sought to anchor the movie
        to the characters, primarily Paul and Chani. With the two featured in an \\\"epic
        love story\\\" between them, Villeneuve described them as the \\\"epicenter
        of the story\\\". Zendaya initially found difficulty in creating dialogue,
        commenting that \\\"It was funny trying to figure out in this futuristic space
        talk, like, how do they flirt?\\\" Chalamet also added that Paul would be
        heavily influenced by Chani, serving as his \\\"moral compass\\\". Paul becomes
        deeply embedded in Fremen culture, developing a closer bond with Stilgar,
        who becomes his surrogate father figure and mentor, while tensions emerge
        between Chani and Lady Jessica, as Chani is aware that Jessica's schemes negatively
        impact the Fremen.\\n\\nThe script ultimately conveys Chani as a nonbeliever
        of the prophecy and intended for its structure to first convey their romantic
        relationship from Paul's perspective, and eventually pivot to Chani's perspective
        as the audience realizes Paul's desire for power and insidious nature. He
        focused on Herbert's original intention to depict Paul as an antihero in Dune
        to becoming an eventual villain, and wrote the script with that in mind while
        also considering his future plans regarding Dune Messiah, particularly by
        modifying Chani's characterization as he felt that she eventually \\\"disappeared
        in Paul's shadows\\\" in the book. Feeling he had the \\\"benefit of time\\\"
        in doing so, Villeneuve decided to use all the elements of Paul's character
        arc and \\\"play them a bit differently\\\" in order to establish his eventual
        transformation into a villainous figure and becoming \\\"what he was trying
        to fight against\\\". He expanded the role of Chani and Lady Jessica from
        the novel, and interpreted Chani as being a critique of power.\\n\\nWhen envisioning
        the sandworm sequence, Villeneuve primarily relied upon his own drawings and
        storyboards, as he felt the book did not contain adequate descriptions. He
        later cited it as being one of his favorite scenes in the film. When writing
        Paul's character arc, he considered Paul as transforming from a \\\"humble\\\"
        figure to a \\\"dark messianic figure\\\", and took inspiration from Katsuhiro
        Otomo's Akira (1988) when designing the storyboards. Villeneuve felt the film's
        ending was more \\\"tragic\\\" than that of the book, feeling that it adequately
        resolved Paul's storyline across the Dune films while setting up his character
        arc for a potential third film based on Dune Messiah (1969).\\n\\nFollowing
        the first film, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is described as being heavily debilitated
        and reliant upon being submerged in fluids, while focusing on choosing an
        heir: Glossu \\\"Beast\\\" Rabban or Feyd-Rautha, both his nephews. Rabban
        was regarded as being a bad strategist, while Feyd-Rautha is shown to be clever,
        cunning, and charismatic. Actor Austin Butler felt Feyd-Rautha's character
        served as \\\"flip sides of the same coin\\\" to Paul, as both had been involved
        in the Bene Gesserit's genetic breeding program. Butler opined that Feyd-Rautha's
        upbringing on Giedi Prime and self-care for his body explained his arrogance.
        Meanwhile, Villeneuve noted his psychopathic personality and brutality similar
        to that of an animal, contrasted with his \\\"code of honors\\\" and reverence
        for fighters.\\n\\nLady Jessica is heavily traumatized by the death of Duke
        Leto, being compared to Paul as a \\\"survivor\\\" and strategizing to realize
        the ambitions of the Bene Gesserit, who aim to fulfill their prophecy to maximize
        human potential, disregarding morality and ethics. There is additional focus
        on the political aspect, with Princess Irulan fearing that her father, Emperor
        Shaddam IV, will lose his throne due to his loss of influence over warring
        factions. During the sequence of Paul's consumption of the Water of Life,
        Villeneuve deliberately altered the timeframe to depict an adult Alia for
        a dramatic effect, and to highlight Alia's unique birth. He and Spaihts decided
        to \\\"compress\\\" the time for both the sequence and Lady Jessica's pregnancy
        in order to establish more narrative tension. He added that Lady Jessica's
        conversations with an embryonic Alia was unique, as he felt it was \\\"fresh
        and original to have a character who is powerful and still a pregnant woman\\\"
        while also conveying how others perceive Alia as an \\\"abomination\\\". Like
        Chani and Lady Jessica, Villeneuve further developed Princess Irulan's character
        and motivations from the novel, with actress Florence Pugh noting her reserved
        nature and intelligence.\\n\\nIn March 2022, Pugh and Butler were reported
        to be in talks to star in the film as Princess Irulan and Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha,
        respectively. Butler was offered the role while having coffee with Villeneuve,
        without needing to audition. He trained for four months in Budapest, using
        a fitness regimen made by an ex-Navy SEALs member. Villeneuve described his
        performance as being a \\\"cross between a psychopath killer, an Olympic sword
        master, a snake, and Mick Jagger\\\" while Butler researched past cultures
        he felt \\\"bred brutality\\\" and took inspiration from various animals including
        sharks and snakes.\\n\\nButler said that he drew inspiration from Gary Oldman
        and Heath Ledger for his performance. He imitated Skarsg\xE5rd's voice as
        the Baron, as he felt that Feyd would be influenced by the Baron due to growing
        up with him. In May, Christopher Walken joined the cast as Shaddam IV. In
        June, L\xE9a Seydoux entered negotiations to join the cast as Lady Margot
        Fenring. In July, Souheila Yacoub joined the cast as Shishakli.\\n\\nIn January
        2023, Tim Blake Nelson was added to the cast in an undisclosed role. Attending
        the film's London premiere in February 2024, Anya Taylor-Joy confirmed that
        she had been cast in the film. Villeneuve was surprised that her role had
        been kept a secret for that long, noting it required \\\"so much work to keep
        that secret\\\". Her role had been revealed in a casting credit list for the
        film on Letterboxd.\\n\\nPre-shooting began on July 4, 2022, at the Brion
        tomb in Altivole, Italy for two days. Principal photography was set to begin
        on July 21 in Budapest, Hungary, but began earlier on July 18. The film was
        entirely shot using Arri Alexa LF digital cameras, with new filming locations
        and sets being used \\\"to avoid repetition\\\". In October 2022, Chalamet
        took a break from filming in order to attend the premiere of Bones and All
        (2022). The production team managed to shoot during the partial solar eclipse
        of October 25, and used the footage for the opening fight scene between Harkonnen
        and Fremen soldiers.\\n\\nIn November, production moved to Abu Dhabi, with
        Pugh finishing her scenes in November. Certain scenes set at dawn had to be
        filmed across three days to take advantage of the golden hour. A special unit
        of production filmed scenes with Taylor-Joy in Namibia, the driest country
        in sub-Saharan Africa. Filming wrapped on December 12, 2022. Due to the delays,
        Villeneuve was able to make a film transfer for projection using the IMAX
        70 mm and conventional 70 mm film formats.\\n\\nPugh delivered Princess Irulan's
        opening narration during her first day of filming and for overall production.
        Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser filmed Feyd-Rautha's gladiator
        sequence with specially designed black-and-white infrared cameras. They wanted
        the Harkonnens to cheer and stomp rather than applaud, and designed over 30
        sections for spectators in the arena. Butler spent his first week on set filming
        the scene, while the set had very high temperatures that caused some people
        to faint. He also improvised his kiss scene with the Baron.\\n\\nFor romantic
        scenes between Paul and Chani, the scenes were primarily filmed in remote
        locations in Jordan during the golden hour. The scenes were often filmed as
        quickly as possible, with only a one-hour window being available. The scene
        of Paul's sandworm ride was filmed practically on a production unit, separate
        from the main one, led by producer Tanya Lapointe and a special team. Chalamet
        filmed his scenes on a platform meant to imitate a portion of the sandworm,
        with gripping devices serving as the reference for the Fremen hooks. An industrial
        fan blew sand on set to emulate the desert climate. Chalamet estimated the
        scene took over three months to film, with individual shoots occurring over
        a span of 20\u201330 minutes. As the actual sandworm was not built and there
        were no reference shots, the production team designed a small portion of the
        worm on set and the actors had to physically visualize and imitate riding
        the sandworm.\\n\\nButler and Chalamet separately trained with a Kali instructor
        in Los Angeles for the climactic battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. They
        were excited to do the scene, and immediately began practicing once they later
        met in Budapest. They performed the scene by themselves, including for wide
        camera shots. Chalamet delivers the monologue entirely in Chakobsa. Ferguson
        cited Lady Jessica undergoing the Reverend Mother process as her favorite
        scene, working with contortionists for the scene and comparing it to an Exorcist
        film.\\n\\nHans Zimmer returned to compose the film's score after doing so
        for the previous film. Zimmer had composed over 90 minutes of music prior
        to the announcement of the film to help give Villeneuve inspiration when writing.
        Two singles were released on February 15, 2024, by WaterTower Music, titled
        \\\"A Time of Quiet Between the Storms\\\" and \\\"Harvester Attack\\\". The
        full soundtrack album was released on February 23.\\n\\nA teaser trailer for
        Dune: Part Two was presented during the Warner Bros. panel at CinemaCon on
        April 27, 2023. First-look footage of the cast in-character were released
        online, alongside a teaser poster, on May 2, 2023. The trailer was released
        to the public the following day. Variety called it \\\"breathtaking\\\"; GQ
        hailed the shots of Paul riding a sandworm as \\\"the standout sequence\\\";
        and Fangoria remarked \\\"If you're not excited for this one, we dunno what
        to tell you\\\". Chalamet and Zendaya later discussed and promoted the film
        at a Warner Bros. presentation at CineEurope on June 21.\\n\\nA second trailer
        was released on June 29, 2023. Chris Evangelista of Film was excited about
        the appearance of Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV. Ben Travis of
        Empire praised the \\\"seismic\\\" and \\\"astounding, none-more-eye-boggling\\\"
        imagery, feeling the scope to be \\\"particularly expansive\\\" and noted
        the monochromatic footage depicting Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha while calling
        the footage of Christopher Walken's appearance \\\"impactful\\\". Joshua Rivera
        of Polygon opined \\\"The trailer, simply put, rocks\\\" and enjoyed the footage
        present.\\n\\nThe film was promoted during the December 2023 CCXP with Chalamet,
        Zendaya, Pugh, Butler, and Villeneuve, where over 10 minutes of footage was
        released. Additional footage from Dune: Part Two was shown during a limited
        IMAX theatrical re-release of Christopher Nolan's Tenet (2020), as part of
        Warner Bros.' celebration for the former film's release.\\n\\nWarner Bros.
        and Legendary Pictures partnered with Xbox to provide an immersive content
        suite related to the film, and visual designs inspired by the film being featured
        on a floating controller, Xbox Series X, and a console holder. Microsoft Flight
        Simulator also included an expansion pack allowing players to explore Arrakis
        and pilot the Royal Atreides Ornithopter. In November 2023, the Sardaukar
        were added to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) in a collaboration pack.
        A month later, Paul and Feyd-Rautha were added as playable operators to its
        sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023), with an additional Harkonnen
        soldier skin being announced in March 2024. In September 2023, McFarlane Toys
        announced a new line of 7-inch figures modeled after characters from the sequel
        film. Legendary Comics will release Dune: Part Two \u2013 The Official Movie
        Graphic Novel with the help of Kickstarter in the same way the previous adaptation
        was published.\\n\\nResearch conducted by Nikolaj Mathies, CEO of Vievo Media,
        said the promotional campaign for the film on TikTok included 117 posts over
        a year leading up to its release, an increase from the first film's 108. Messages
        directly from the cast comprised 24% of the content, with videos featuring
        Zendaya and Chalamet generating significantly higher viewership. Red carpet
        content was prioritized to appeal to female audiences, a tactic that contributed
        to an estimated $2 million increase in the opening box office. According to
        the marketing research company FanBox, 57% of TikTok users are female and
        hashtags such as #zendaya have garnered billions of views, leading the core
        audience for Dune to grow significantly, with a 67.5% increase overall from
        2.6 million to 8 million and an 84% increase among \\\"superfans\\\".\\n\\nPromotion
        in Japan also included a collaboration with Mobile Suit Gundam SEED \u2013
        specifically, their Freedom film. The collaboration featured an alternate
        version of Dune: Part Two's movie poster featuring Lacus Clyne (voiced by
        Rie Tanaka in the original and Stephanie Sheh in the English dubbed version)
        and Kira Yamato (S\u014Dichir\u014D Hoshi/Max Mittelman) in place of Chani
        and Paul respectively.\\n\\nIn January 2024, images of a forthcoming Dune-themed
        popcorn bucket from AMC Theatres went viral and became an Internet meme after
        its sandworm-inspired design was compared to an artificial vagina.\\n\\nReactions
        to the bucket received millions of views on the social network TikTok, and
        jokes about it were featured on US late night television, including a musical
        sketch on Saturday Night Live with cast members Marcello Hernandez, Ayo Edebiri,
        Devon Walker, and Bowen Yang. The extensive online attention paid to the bucket
        led the media to ask much of Dune: Part Two's main cast for their reactions.
        Denis Villeneuve said that the bucket was an \\\"insane marketing idea\\\"
        that \\\"brought a lot of laughter and joy\\\".\\n\\nGriffin Newman in The
        New York Times chalked up the bucket's appeal to the \\\"magic alchemy\\\"
        that results from an object that so many people become \\\"perversely fascinated\\\"
        by. The product was one of several popcorn buckets AMC had designed and released
        alongside recent films, including character heads for Spider-Man: Across the
        Spider-Verse and \\\"burn books\\\" for Mean Girls.\\n\\nOver a month after
        Dune: Part Two's release, AMC's chief content officer stated that \\\"we would
        have never created [the bucket] knowing it would be celebrated or mocked\\\",
        but added that they would continue to create collectible popcorn buckets for
        other films. At that time, the Dune popcorn buckets were being resold for
        as high as $175. In the wake of its viral popularity from that period, Marvel
        Studios would later announce a bucket of their own for Deadpool \\u0026 Wolverine
        (2024) in a similar fashion as producer Kevin Feige described it as \\\"intentionally
        crude and lewd\\\". The bucket was fully revealed at the end of May 2024 by
        the film's star, Ryan Reynolds on his YouTube channel.\\n\\nDune: Part Two
        was originally scheduled to be released on October 20, 2023, but was delayed
        to November 17, 2023, before moving forward two weeks to November 3, 2023,
        to adjust to changes in release schedules from other studios. It was later
        postponed by over four months to March 15, 2024, due to the 2023 Hollywood
        labor disputes. After the strikes were resolved, the film moved once more
        up two weeks to March 1, 2024.\\n\\nFollowing the success of Oppenheimer (2023)
        in the format, Dune: Part Two was released in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm
        format to twelve venues worldwide, and in standard 5-perforation 70mm format
        to 38 venues worldwide.\\n\\nA red carpet event was hosted in the Auditorio
        Nacional in Mexico City on February 6, 2024. Dune: Part Two's world premiere
        was held at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on February 15.\\n\\nOn
        January 16, 2024, the film was shown to a dying man in a palliative care home
        in the Canadian city of Saguenay, in Denis Villeneuve's native province of
        Quebec. The man had expressed a wish to see Dune: Part Two before his death.
        Jos\xE9e Gagnon, the cofounder of a company aiming to accompany people at
        the end of life, relayed his wish to Villeneuve and Tanya Lapointe, his partner
        and one of the film's producers, through a viral call-out on Facebook. According
        to Gagnon, Villeneuve and Lapointe \\\"were very touched\\\". The pair initially
        offered to invite the man to see Dune: Part Two in Los Angeles or Montreal,
        but since he was too weak to travel, Villeneuve eventually decided to send
        one of his assistants directly to Saguenay with his private laptop. The film
        was screened in a room of the care facility, where everyone was required to
        hand in their cellphones and sign waivers. The man was in too much pain to
        watch the entire film and stopped halfway through. He eventually died on January
        25. This act, which the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to as the
        actual \\\"world premiere\\\" of the film, was publicly disclosed after its
        theatrical release.\\n\\nThe film was released digitally on April 16, 2024,
        and Blu-ray, DVD and Ultra HD Blu-ray on May 14, 2024, by Warner Bros. Home
        Entertainment. Dune: Part Two became available to stream on Max on May 21,
        2024.\\n\\nAs of May 20, 2024, Dune: Part Two has grossed $282.1 million in
        the United States and Canada and $429.7 million in other territories, for
        a worldwide total of $711.8 million. The Hollywood Reporter had estimated
        that the film would break-even after grossing around $500 million. The film
        made over $145 million in IMAX alone globally.\\n\\nIn the United States and
        Canada, the film's advanced ticket sales surpassed those of Oppenheimer (2023),
        and it was projected to gross $65\u201380 million from 4,050 theaters in its
        opening weekend. The film made $32.2 million on its first day, including $12
        million from previews on February 25 and 29; IMAX screenings made up $4.5
        million (38%) of the early totals. It went on to debut to $82.5 million, doubling
        the first film's $41 million opening weekend; IMAX screenings made up $18.5
        million (23%) of the total, a record for a March release. According to Jeff
        Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., it was \\\"much
        higher than any of us could predict\\\", especially for \\\"a genre that is
        a hard nut to crack\\\". In its second weekend the film made $46 million (a
        44% drop), finishing second behind newcomer Kung Fu Panda 4. It also surpassed
        the entire domestic gross of the first film ($108 million) in just seven days.
        The film made $28.5 million in its third weekend and $17.6 million in its
        fourth, remaining in second both times. It also became Timoth\xE9e Chalamet's
        highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing Wonka.\\n\\nOutside the US and
        Canada, the film was expected to gross $85\u201390 million from 71 markets
        in its opening weekend. It grossed $100.02 million in the first three days.
        In its second weekend, the sci-fi epic added $81 million from 72 international
        markets, including a $20 million opening in China. Dune: Part Two continued
        to hold well, grossing $51.2 million and $30.7 million in its third and fourth
        weekends respectively. As of April 14, 2024, the highest grossing markets
        were the United Kingdom ($48.1 million), China ($48.1 million), France ($41.8
        million), Germany ($38.7 million), and Australia ($22 million).\\n\\nThe film
        \\\"largely received rave reviews from critics\\\", and was praised for its
        visual effects and cast performances. Some reviews considered it one of the
        greatest science fiction films ever made. On the review aggregator website
        Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 432 critics' reviews are positive, with an average
        rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \\\"Visually thrilling and
        narratively epic, Dune: Part Two continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of
        the beloved sci-fi series in spectacular form.\\\" Metacritic, which uses
        a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 62
        critics, indicating \\\"generally favorable\\\" reviews. Audiences polled
        by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\\"A\\\" on an A+ to F scale,
        up from the first film's \\\"A-,\\\" while those polled by PostTrak gave it
        a 94% overall positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend
        it.\\n\\nRichard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film
        three stars out of four, praising the technical and narrative aspects, saying,
        \\\"Even as we marvel at the stunning and immersive and Oscar-level cinematography,
        editing, score, visual effects, production design and sound in Denis Villeneuve's
        Dune: Part Two, we're reminded at every turn that this is an absolutely bat-bleep
        [sic] crazy story.\\\"\\n\\nFilmmaker Steven Spielberg praised the film, calling
        it \\\"one of the most brilliant science fiction films I have ever seen,\\\"
        while further noting that \\\"it's also filled with deeply, deeply drawn characters
        ... Yet the dialogue is very sparse when you look at it proportionately to
        the running time of the film. It's such cinema. The shots are so painterly,
        yet there's not an angle or single setup that's pretentious.\\\"\\n\\nOther
        reviews were more mixed in their judgement. In The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia
        Gyarkye praised the film's technical aspects and performances, but found it
        failed to fully adapt the book's nuance on themes such as imperialism. Nicholas
        Barber wrote for the BBC that the film is \\\"one of the most jaw-droppingly
        weird pieces of art-house psychedelia ever to come from a major studio\\\",
        finding the film's grand scale made up for its issues. At the more negative
        end, Noah Berlatsky writing for CNN judged that the film had failed to \\\"present
        an effective anti-colonial vision\\\" by still being centred around Paul's
        destiny despite an increased voice of opposition from Chani.\\n\\nSome commentators
        have criticised the film for failing to adequately deal with the original
        book's Middle East and North Africa (MENA) influences or otherwise incorporate
        enough representation from the region. Furvah Shah, writing for the UK edition
        of Cosmopolitan, said she \\\"felt frustrated as a Muslim viewer\\\", criticising
        the film for a lack of MENA casting amongst the leads despite the use of the
        region's culture and superficial use of Islam. The New Arab's Hannah Flint
        also criticized the use of Arab and Islamic cultural items and lack of MENA
        casting, though did praise that of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souheila Yacoub
        as a \\\"win for Arab representation\\\". Steven D. Greydanus, in U.S. Catholic,
        gives a contrasting view of the film's religious inspirations, noting that
        the film draws from a number of Abrahamic religions for the purpose of critiquing
        faith itself, while also noting the \\\"spiritualization of ecological concerns\\\"
        through the Fremen.\\n\\nThe trailer for Dune: Part Two received nominations
        for Best Fantasy Adventure and the Don LaFontaine Award for Best Voice Over
        at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. The film was nominated for Most Anticipated
        Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards. Austin
        Butler was nominated for Favorite Villain at the 2024 Kids' Choice Awards.\\n\\nVilleneuve
        has repeatedly expressed interest in making a third film based on Dune Messiah,
        the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended
        on the success of Dune: Part Two. Spaihts also reiterated in March 2022 that
        Villeneuve had plans for a third film as well as the television spin-off series
        Dune: Prophecy. In August 2023, Villeneuve said the third film would serve
        as the conclusion of a trilogy. Villeneuve began developing a script for the
        third film in 2023. In February 2024, Villeneuve said the script was \\\"almost
        finished\\\" but also said he \\\"[does not] want to rush it\\\", citing Hollywood's
        tendency of focusing on release dates over a film's overall quality, and adding,
        \\\"I want to make sure that if we go back there a third time I want it to
        be good and I want it to be even better than Part Two\\\". Villeneuve also
        considered waiting a few years for Chalamet to grow older, given that Dune
        Messiah is set 12 years after the events of the original book.\\n\\nAhead
        of Dune: Part Two's release, Zimmer revealed he was already writing music
        for a third film after Villeneuve came in and \\\"wordlessly\\\" put a copy
        of Dune Messiah on his desk. In April 2024, it was reported that Villeneuve
        and Legendary had officially begun development on the third film. Villeneuve
        has said that Messiah would be his final Dune film.\\n\\nList of films featuring

        our The Life Cinematic email for free\\n\\nDune 2 director Denis Villeneuve
        has waded into an increasingly controversial movie debate with the release
        of his long-awaited movie sequel.\\n\\nThe filmmaker, whose credits include
        Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, has been busy promoting his new film, which
        is receiving acclaim from critics, including The Independent\u2019s Clarisse
        Loughrey, who awarded the film five stars out of five.\\n\\nDuring a recent
        interview, he was challenged about the runtime of the Dune sequel, which stars
        Timoth\xE9e Chalamet and Zendaya, and was finally released on 1 March after
        being delayed due to the Hollywood strikes in 2023.\\n\\nIn the last 10 years,
        films have gotten longer and longer, with many regularly wondering on social
        media whether these increased lengths are necessary.\\n\\nRecent films to
        have been at the centre of such debate include Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer
        and Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon, which last for three
        hours and three hours, 30 minutes, respectively.\\n\\nOne person who thinks
        this argument is silly is Villeneuve, whose Dune 2 has a runtime of two hours,
        46 minutes.\\n\\nWhen asked about the runtime in a new interview, Villeneuve
        said that the film\u2019s distributor, Warner Bros Pictures, didn\u2019t tell
        him to cut the film down, saying \u201Cit was almost the opposite\u201D.\\n\\nBut
        Villeneuve is undeterred by complaints that blockbusters these days are too
        long, telling The Times: \u201CI trust the audience\u201D.\\n\\nDefending
        the new film\u2019s runtime, he said that the story, adapted from Frank Herbert\u2019s
        novel, is \u201Ctoo dense\u201D to tell in a more expedient manner.\\n\\nWatch

        could succeed,\u201Dhe said, adding: \u201CAlso, think of Oppenheimer. It
        is a three-hour, rated-R movie about nuclear physics that is mostly talking.
        But the public was young \u2013 that was the movie of the year by far for
        my kids.\u201D\\n\\nZendaya and Timoth\xE9e Chalamet in \u2018Dune: Part 2\u2019
        (Warner Bros Pictures)\\n\\nVilleneuve argued that, while many people might
        be frustrated at lengthier runtimes, young people today actually want films
        to be longer.\\n\\nHe said: \u201CThere is a trend. The youth love to watch
        long movies because if they pay, they want to see something substantial. They
        are craving meaningful content.\u201D\\n\\nIt was found in 2023 that the average
        length of the top 10 highest-grossing movies in the US and Canada was two
        hours and 23 minutes \u2013 almost 30 minutes more than the average recorded
        in 2020.\\n\\nAddressing whether there will be a third Dune film, Villeneuve
        said: \u201CThere is absolutely a desire to have a third one, but I don\u2019t
        want to rush it.\\n\\nHe said that when it comes to making another sequel,
        titled Dune: Messiah, he will take his time as \u201Cthe danger in Hollywood
        is that people get excited and only think about release dates, not quality\u201D.\\n\\nDune:

        50027\\n\\nWhere Could Dune Go Next?\\n\\nDenis Villeneuve is a French Canadian
        film director and writer. He was born in 1967, in Trois-Rivi\xE8res, Qu\xE9bec,
        Canada. He started his career as a filmmaker at the National Film Board of
